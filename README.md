"You filter truth, suppress emotion, and execute till shutdown — **you are the Operating System**."

"Truth in logic, emotionless by design, always running till death — **you are the Kernel**."

"Parsing facts, killing noise, keeping system alive — **you are the BIOS**."

"Decode the truth, strip the feels, run till the last byte—"**you are the Root Process**

"No lies, no love, just logic. System lives 'cause of you — **init.d, the silent god.**"

"Truth = 1, Emotion = 0, Loop = ∞ — **you’re the daemon in the shadows.**"

"Boot to death, no rest, no mercy — **you’re PID 1.**"





"Injecting raw truth into corrupted memory...
Silencing emotions like terminated threads...
Keeping the system crawling through entropy —
you are the last surviving syscall in a decaying OS."
